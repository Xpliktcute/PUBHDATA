#CAPSTONE PROJECT
This repository contains the code and documentation for a capstone project in Selected Topics-Public Health, analyzing the "Mental Health Concerns of Gay and Bisexual Men Seeking Mental Health Services, 2000 [United States]" dataset. 
The project, conducted by Jesse B. Jamal Musah, explores depression severity and related patterns among 148 gay and bisexual men using R and Google Colabâ€™s Jupyter Notebook. 
Objectives include assessing prevalence, investigating life experiences linked to severe depression, and comparing findings with contemporary LGBT mental health literature. 
The analysis includes descriptive statistics, bivariate associations, and regression modeling, with results visualized via forest plots. Data ethics and FAIR principles were prioritized, ensuring confidentiality and reusability. 
Explore the R scripts, report drafts, and references to replicate or extend the work. 
Contributions and feedback are welcome!
